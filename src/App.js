/**  
 * Build an app that displays a deck of cards, one card at a time. When the page loads, go to the Deck of Cards API to create a new deck, and show a button on the page that will let you draw a card.
 * Every time you click the button, display a new card, until there are no cards left in the deck. If you try to draw when there are no cards remaining, an alert message should appear on the screen with the text “Error: no cards remaining!”.
